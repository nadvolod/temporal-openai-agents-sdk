# Temporal + OpenAI Agents SDK Workshop

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/your-username/temporal-ai-agents-workshop)

Learn to build **durable AI agents** using **OpenAI Agents SDK + Temporal** in this hands-on 90-minute workshop. Everything runs in GitHub Codespaces with zero local setup required.

## üéØ What You'll Build

By the end of this workshop, you'll understand how to:

- Create AI agents with tool calling using OpenAI's API
- Build durable workflows with Temporal for reliability and retries
- Combine both to create production-ready AI agents that survive failures
- Implement multi-agent systems with handoff patterns
- Observe and debug agent execution using Temporal UI

## üìã Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- GitHub account (for Codespaces)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

#### üìì One-Click Temporal Installation (Recommended)

For easiest setup, use the Jupyter notebook:

1. Open `temporal_installation.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter Lab
2. Run each cell to:
   - Install the Temporal CLI
   - Start the Temporal dev server

This method works in Codespaces, local dev containers, and most Linux environments.

---

1. Click the "Open in GitHub Codespaces" badge above
2. Wait ~90 seconds for the environment to set up
3. Add your OpenAI API key to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY
   ```
4. Start Temporal server:
   ```bash
   make temporal-up
   ```
5. You're ready to start the exercises!

### Option 2: Local Setup

#### üìì One-Click Temporal Installation (Recommended)

You can also use the Jupyter notebook for local setup:

1. Open `temporal_installation.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter Lab
2. Run each cell to:
   - Install the Temporal CLI
   - Start the Temporal dev server

## üìö Workshop Structure

This is a 90-minute workshop: **30 minutes instruction + 4√ó15 minute exercises**

## Intro to OpenAI Agents SDK

[Slides 4-11](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZKj-PUm8-swnwP7jQPyQNMs4NIBAuCuglU3iByWn4CM/edit?slide=id.g38cc80f1e1e_1_0#slide=id.g38cc80f1e1e_1_0)

### Exercise 1: Agent Hello World

**Goal:** Create a simple AI agent with tool calling

- Build your first OpenAI agent with a weather tool
- Understand the agent ‚Üí tool ‚Üí response flow
- See how LLMs decide when to use tools

**Run it:**

```bash
# Open the Jupyter notebook:
# exercises/01_agent_hello_world/exercise.ipynb
```

### Exercise 2: Temporal Hello World

**Goal:** Understand Temporal workflows and activities

- Create your first Temporal workflow
- Learn about activities as units of work
- Observe execution in the Temporal UI

**Run it:**

```bash
make temporal-up    # Start Temporal server
# Open the Jupyter notebook:
# exercises/02_temporal_hello_world/exercise.ipynb
```

### Exercise 3: Durable Agent

**Goal:** Combine agents + Temporal for production durability

- Wrap LLM calls in Temporal activities
- Get automatic retries on failures
- Persist agent state across crashes
- Add observability with trace IDs

**Run it:**

```bash
# Open the Jupyter notebook:
# exercises/03_durable_agent/exercise.ipynb
```

### Exercise 4: Multi-Agent Handoff

**Goal:** Build multi-agent systems with workflow orchestration

- Implement agent routing/triage patterns
- Create specialized agents for different tasks
- Orchestrate agent handoffs with Temporal
- Maintain context across agent transitions

**Run it:**

```bash
# Open the Jupyter notebook:
# exercises/04_multi_agent_handoff/exercise.ipynb
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Commands

```bash
# Setup and validation
make setup          # Install all dependencies
make env            # Check environment variables

# Development
make lint           # Run code linters
make test           # Run test suite

# Temporal
make temporal-up    # Start Temporal dev server
make temporal-down  # Stop Temporal server

# Exercises (Jupyter notebooks only)
# Open exercises/01_agent_hello_world/exercise.ipynb
# Open exercises/02_temporal_hello_world/exercise.ipynb
# Open exercises/03_durable_agent/exercise.ipynb
# Open exercises/04_multi_agent_handoff/exercise.ipynb
```

## üîç Key Concepts

### Why Temporal for AI Agents?

AI agents in production face several challenges:

1. **API Failures:** LLM APIs can be rate-limited or temporarily unavailable
2. **Crashes:** Your agent process might crash mid-execution
3. **Long-Running Operations:** Multi-step agent flows need to resume from checkpoints
4. **Observability:** You need to debug what your agent actually did

Temporal solves these by providing:

- **Automatic retries** with configurable policies
- **State persistence** across failures and restarts
- **Execution history** for debugging and auditing
- **Durable execution** that survives crashes

### Architecture Pattern

```
User Query
    ‚Üì
Temporal Workflow (orchestration layer)
    ‚Üì
Activity: Call LLM with tools
    ‚Üì
[If tool needed] Activity: Execute tool
    ‚Üì
Activity: Get final LLM response
    ‚Üì
Return to user
```

Each activity can retry independently, and the entire flow is durable.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Environment Issues

**Problem:** `OPENAI_API_KEY` not found

```bash
# Check your .env file exists
ls -la .env

# Verify the key is set
python scripts/check_env.py
```

**Problem:** Temporal server not running

```bash
# Check if it's running
pgrep -f temporal

# Start it
make temporal-up

# Or manually
temporal server start-dev
```

### Exercise Issues

**Problem:** Import errors when running exercises

```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Problem:** Notebook kernel not found

```bash
# Install ipykernel
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name temporal-workshop
```

## üéì Instructor Notes

### Timing Breakdown

- **00:00-5:00** - Introduction & Setup verification
- **5:00-15:00** - OpenAI Agents SDK Introduction (slides)
- **15:00-30:00** - Exercise 1 + Q&A
- **25:00-35:00** - Solution to 1
- **35:00-40:00** - Intro to Temporal (slides)
- **40:00-55:00** - Exercise 2 + Q&A
- **55:00-65:00** - Solution to 2
- **65:00-70:00** - OpenAI Agents SDK + Temporal (slides)
- **70:00-85:00** - Exercise 3
- **85:00-90:00** - Closing

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Students skip checking `.env`** - Do environment check before starting
2. **Temporal not running** - Remind students to run `make temporal-up` for Ex 2+
3. **Tool call parsing** - Show the `eval()` pattern for function arguments (or use `json.loads()` in production)
4. **Activity timeouts** - Explain start_to_close_timeout defaults

### Key Teaching Points

- **Exercise 1:** Emphasize tool calling as the foundation of agentic behavior
- **Exercise 2:** Show the Temporal UI extensively - it's powerful for debugging
- **Exercise 3:** THIS IS THE KEY - show how activities make LLM calls durable
- **Exercise 4:** Advanced - focus on the routing pattern and context passing
